(** * The Cycle Decomposition of a Permutation

This files deals with decomposition of permutation into cycles. We define the
following notions, where [s] is a permutation over a finite type [T]:

- [psupport s] == the set of non fixed points for [s]
- [porbit_set s] == the set of the supports of the cycles of [s]
- [s \is cyclic] == [s] is a cyclic permutation
- [perm_dec E s] == for [E : {set {set T}}] the set of the restriction of [s]
                    to the elements of [E].
- [cycle_dec s] == the decomposition of [s] in cyclic permutations.
- [disjoint_supports A] == For [A : {set {perm T}}], the element of [A]
                    have pairwise dijoint supports.
- [cycle_dec_spec s A] == [A] is a decomposition of [s] into disjoint cycles.

The main result is Theorem [cycle_decP] which asserts that [cycle_dec s] is
the unique decomposition of [s] into disjoint cycles:

  [ unique (cycle_dec_spec s) (cycle_dec s). ]
